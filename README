add the path of the functions to call them from anywehre use the following 
command in the matlab prompt -

To extract data run the script called "scriptHecHMSDataPrep.m". Either run
it from the graphical interface using F5 or use the following command in the
command prompt -

>>> scriptHecHMSDataPrep

It will ask for a file with .nc ending. It will invoke the graphical or text
